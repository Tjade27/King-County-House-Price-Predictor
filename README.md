This project is still **in progress**.  


## Overview 

King County is a county in the US state of Washington. At the 2010 census, the county had 1,931,249 inhabitants and a population density of 350.7 inhabitants per square kilometer. The county administration is located in Seattle.

As real estate prices in densely populated areas are skyrocketing, predicting the correct price for a house or apartment based on its features like living area, number of bedrooms etc. is of major importance.

## Business Case:  

In this project the goal is to implement and evaluate a multivariate linear regression model that allows the user to predict the real estate price of a chosen object based on its features.


## Outcome / Findings:

The outcome of the project is a multivariate linear regression model with an **R2-Score** of **84%**.
